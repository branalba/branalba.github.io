Recently I switched from my Microsoft Surface Book 2 to a Thinkpad X1 Extreme Gen 2, in no small part due to the former's compatibility issues with Linux. While a [custom kernel](https://github.com/linux-surface/linux-surface) does exist to make Linux work with Surface devices, the resulting setup remained too unstable for me to be comfortable using it as my daily driver, so by popular recommendation I'm making the switch to a Thinkpad. 

Having run Fedora and Ubuntu in the past and subsequently improved my Linux skills by a wide margin, I'm looking at Arch as my next OS to try. I like the idea of building my OS from the ground up, and the Arch Wiki seems to be a fantastic resource to draw from, even featuring a [dedicated page](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Lenovo_ThinkPad_X1_Extreme_(Gen_2)) for the X1 Extreme Gen 2. This post serves to document my process of learning both how to install and configure Arch Linux with a desktop environment (I'll be using GNOME) and making it compatibile with all of my hardware, which according to the Wiki should be possible for every part of this laptop, including the fingerprint reader and Nvidia GeForceÂ® GTX 1650.
