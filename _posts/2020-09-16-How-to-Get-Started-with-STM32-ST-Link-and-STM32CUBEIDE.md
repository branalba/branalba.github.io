For those getting deeper into the world of microcontrollers and embedded systems, you probably started with Arduino but eventually started hitting roadblocks as your projects became more advanced -- be it not enough choices of microcontrollers to suit your needs, low-resolution ADCs, no debugging tools in the Arduino IDE, and many other things that at a certain point start holding the humble Arduino board back. If you find yourself in this position, the STM32 ecosystem might be for you. With dozens more microcontroller choices, much faster chips with low-power choices, and much wider bandwidth for communication and analog sampling, STM32 chips can help take your projects and skills to a new level.
