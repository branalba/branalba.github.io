I am a 3rd-year electrical engineering student with a focus in PCB design, analog circuit design and analysis, and embedded systems. My most notable projects include: the design of actuator control PCBs and other critical boards as the lead of a microsatellite project's electrical team, and the circuit, PCB, and firmware design of an bioimpedance-sensing board designed to measure cells for the purpose of selecting embryos for IVF. 

Frameworks, programming languages, and software with which I have professional experience include: Python, C++, PlatformIO, STM32, Git, LTSpice, and Autodesk Fusion 360 (electronics design). I am also familiar with KiCAD, Altium Designer, Autodesk EAGLE, UNIX-like systems, OrCAD Capture CIS, and Quartus Prime.
